Server process to orchestrate running reports.  This is not in the [main package](https://github.com/vimc/orderly) because it may move into our [api](https://github.com/vimc/montagu-reporting-api) and because it drags in some dependencies that will never usually be needed.

Current API:

```
POST /reports/:name/run
POST /reports/:name/:version/commit
POST /reports/:name/:version/publish
GET /reports/:name/:version/status
POST /reports/rebuild
```

All the query stuff is already dealt with in [montagu-reporting-api](https://github.com/vimc/montagu-reporting-api) and will not be duplicated here.
